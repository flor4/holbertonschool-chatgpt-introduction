# Enhancing Code Quality and Efficiency with ChatGPT

### Objectives


-Debugging: Understand the practical use of AI in identifying and solving coding errors. You will use ChatGPT to diagnose and correct bugs in provided code samples across multiple programming languages. This will enhance your problem-solving skills and understanding of common programming pitfalls in a diverse set of coding environments.
-Automation: Learn how to automate mundane and repetitive coding tasks with the assistance of ChatGPT. This involves generating boilerplate code, documentation, and even basic unit tests, freeing up time to focus on more complex and creative aspects of software development.
Outcomes

-Enhanced Debugging Skills: Gain confidence in troubleshooting and refining code, with an ability to articulate problems clearly and implement AI-driven solutions effectively.
-Automation Proficiency: Develop skills to leverage AI for automating coding tasks, leading to more structured and errorfree code.
Through this project, you will engage in hands-on activities that reflect real-world scenarios, pushing the boundaries of traditional coding methods with AI integration. This approach not only prepares you for future technological advancements but also equips you with skills that are increasingly in demand in the tech industry. Get ready to transform the way you code by making it smarter, faster, and more efficient!
